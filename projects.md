    <b>Software Development Engineer (Microsoft) - Summer 2014 Internship</b>: 
    For a long time I have wanted to work at a top tech company. I am happy to report that I accepted a software engineering internship position with Microsoft!! I worked on the <a href="http://onedrive.com">OneDrive</a> team where I built notifications for users with expired/expiring bonus storage. My code is run about 3.5 million times a day (1000 times a second) and it maintains a quality of service of 99.998%. At the conclusion of my internship I was offered a full time position which I ended up accepting in August of 2014!

    <b>Personal Data Report</b>: I have been interested in personal data for a long time. In 2013 I created this personal data report using D3.js. I only had a small amount of data but the project was super fun. I was inspired by <a href="http://jehiah.cz/one-two/">Jehiah Czebotar's Personal Annual Reports</a>.<br>

    <b>SOFTWARE ENGINEER (KIT SOLUTIONS) - SUMMER 2013 INTERNSHIP</b>: For summer 2013 I worked as a software engineer at KIT Solutions where I built a time sheet web app! This app is no ordinary time sheet, it integrates with active directory to add and remove users and keep each employee's profile up to date, all automatically! I used .Net MVC and C# to build the app. As a time sheet, the app's primary feature is to track the time employees work on individual contracts and projects which will help to better price services to clients.

    <b>Weight Calculator</b>: I have put the wrong weight on the barbell while weight lifting too many times. So many that I decided to make this little barbell weight calculator to assist me. Before I had most weight combinations in my range memorized, I did use this calculator a bit to double check.<br>
