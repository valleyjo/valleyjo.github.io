# Professional Background
I work on container lifecycle management on the Microsoft Azure Compute team. This is a core service upon which all of Azure -- first and third party -- is built.

Previously I worked on the OneDrive sync team where I worked on the mac and windows apps. I love working on mission critical projects and the oppertunity to make a big impact.
