								<p>
									I was inspired by Nicholas Feltron's Personal Annual Reports and decided to create my own report, however the task of collecting 50MB of textual data on myself (as Nick does each year) sounds daunting. I opted to collect only a few months worth of data on myself. After collecting the data I took to representing it in D3! <a href="pdr.html">Check it out here!</a>

								<h3>Software Engineer - Summer 2013 Internship</h3>
								<p>
									For summer 2013 I am working as a software engineer at <a href="http://www.kitsolutions.net/" target="_blank">KIT Solutions</a> where I am building a time sheet web app! This app is no ordinary timesheet, it integrats with active directory to add and remove users and keep each employee's profile  up to date, all automatically! I am using .Net MVC and C# to build the app. As a timesheet, the app's primary feature is to track the time employees work on individual contracts and projects which will help us to better price our services to clients.

								<p>
									In May of 2012 I traveled to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam to participate in the Plus3 engineering study abroad program. While in HCMC I learned an unimaginable amount of information. We toured many domestic and international companies and learned about their operations. We took courses at our partner university, the University of Economics and Finance (UEF), and we got to spend countless hours with our Vietnamese peers who attend UEF. Most importantly, I gained an international perspective; I learned how similar all of humanity really is. I learned that people all over the world can work together to achieve a common goal. If you are interested in reading more about my trip, view my <a href="http://alexvallejovietnamplus3.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> where I have detailed postings on my experiances each day (link on the sidebar). Tôi yêu Việt Nam (I love Vietnam)!

								<p>
									For the Engineering Computing class, everyone must write a conference paper detailing some relevant 
						            technology or advancement in their prospective field of engineering. My friend 
						            <a href="http://andrewmland.com/" target="_blank" >Drew</a> and I chose to reaearch the Tegra 3 system on a chip made by Nvidia. Our conference paper can be downloaded <a href="resources/AlexVallejo_Tegra3.docx" target="_blank" >here</a>.
