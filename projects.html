              <h3>Software Development Engineer (Microsoft) - Summer 2014</h3>
              <p>For a long time I have wanted to work at a top tech company.
              I am happy to report that I have accepted a software engineering
              internship position with Microsoft for summer 2014!! I will be
              working as a SDE with the <a href="http://onedrive.com">OneDrive</a>
              team. I have a blog post detailing my experience with the Microsoft
              interview process.
              </p>

              <h3><a href="pdr.html">Personal Data Report</a></h3>
              <p>I was inspired by <a href="http://jehiah.cz/one-two/">Jehiah
              Czebotar's Personal Annual Reports</a> and decided to create my
              own report. I collected only a small amount of data on myself in
              comparison to Jehiah. After collecting the data I took to
              representing it via D3! <a href="pdr.html">Check it out here!</a>

              <h3>Software Engineer (KIT Solutions) - Summer 2013 Internship</h3>
              <p>For summer 2013 I worked as a software engineer at
              <a href="http://www.kitsolutions.net/">KIT Solutions</a> where I
              built a timesheet web app! This app is no ordinary timesheet,
              it integrates with active directory to add and remove users and
              keep each employee's profile up to date, all automatically!
              I used .Net MVC and C# to build the app. As a timesheet, the app's
              primary feature is to track the time employees work on individual
              contracts and projects which will help to better price services
              to clients.

              <h3><a href="http://alexvallejovietnamplus3.blogspot.com/">Plus3 Vietnam - Study Abroad</a></h3>
              <p> In May of 2012 I traveled to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam to
              participate in the Plus3 engineering study abroad program. While
              in HCMC I grew tremendously as a person. We toured many domestic
              and international companies and learned about their operations. We
              took courses at our partner university, the University of Economics
              and Finance (UEF), and we got to spend countless hours with our
              Vietnamese peers who attend UEF. Most importantly, I gained an
              international perspective; I learned how similar all of humanity
              really is. I learned that people all over the world can work
              together to achieve a common goal. If you are interested in
              reading more about my trip, view my
              <a href="http://alexvallejovietnamplus3.blogspot.com/">blog</a>
              where I have detailed postings on my activities each day
              (link on the sidebar). Tôi yêu Việt Nam (I love Vietnam)!

              <h3><a href="resources/AlexVallejo_Tegra3.docx">ENGR 12 Research Paper</a></h3>
              <p>For the Engineering Computing class, everyone must write a
              conference paper detailing some relevant technology or advancement
              in their prospective field of engineering. My friend
              <a href="http://andrewmland.com/">Drew</a> and I chose to research
              the Tegra 3 system on a chip made by Nvidia. Our conference paper
              can be downloaded <a href="resources/AlexVallejo_Tegra3.docx">here</a>.
              We are proud to have earned an A on our paper, and we learned a
              great deal from our research.
