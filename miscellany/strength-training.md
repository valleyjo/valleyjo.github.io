<h1>Journey</h1>
<p>I first started weight lifting in 2013. I was twenty years old and I weighed 120lbs. After a stressful first year of college I lost some weight and was unhealthily skinny. A friend encouraged me to go to the gym so I reached out so some friends I know had experience in the gym. I was introduced to strong lifts 5x5 which was a great starting program. I gained 10lbs within the first three months -- love those beginner gains!</p>

<p>I have had a few periods of stagnation with minor regression but nothing major. I've also built new strength over a few periods. Between January-September 2015 I gained another 10 pounds as I finished school and took some time off before working full time. Within the past year I've gotten much stronger and leaned out, producing my best results at my lowest body weight in some time.</p>

<h1>Barbell Weight Calculator</h1>
<p>I put the wrong weight on the barbell an embarrising number of times. I made this weight calculator a long time ago to help me never make this mistake again!</p>
