            <p>My full name is Alexander Manuel Vallejo, and I was born on
            December 3rd, 1992. I have lived my entire life around the
            Pittsburgh area. I attended <a href="http://www.olsh.org">Our Lady
            of the Sacred Heart</a> High School where I was the director of the
            school news studio, a member of NHS, and a varsity volleyball player.
            Also while in high school I was an active member in <a href="http://www.troop335.net">
            Boy Scout Troop 335</a> and achieved the rank of Eagle Scout at
            age fifteen. I began attending the Swanson School of Engineering at
            the University of Pittsburgh in the fall of 2011.
            </p>

            <p>In college I major in computer engineering and maintain a GPA in
            the top 5% of my department while participating in several
            extra-ciricular activities. I have served as: Secretary of my
            fraternity (Delta Chi), Freshmen Engineering Peer advisor, Technical
            Director of the Green Hope Orphanage Inc, and president of the Pitt
            chapter of IEEE.
            </p>

            <p>In the summer of 2013 I worked as a software engineer intern for
            <a href="http://kitsolutions.net">KIT Solutions</a> where I developed
            an internal timesheet application. In the summer of 2014 I will be
            working for <a href="http:microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> as a SDET for
            the Windows Services division. I could not be more excited to move
            to Seattle for the summer and work for Microsoft! It has been a dream
            of mine to work for Microsoft (or another top tech company) since
            2008. Lots of hard work, determination and especially persistance
            got me to where I am today.
