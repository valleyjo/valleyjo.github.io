            <p>My full name is Alexander Manuel Vallejo, and I was born on
            December 3rd, 1992. I have lived my entire life around the
            Pittsburgh area. I attended <a href="http://www.olsh.org">Our Lady
            of the Sacred Heart</a> High School where I was the director of the
            school news studio, a member of NHS, and a varsity volleyball player.
            Also while in high school I was an active member in <a href="http://www.troop335.net">
            Boy Scout Troop 335</a> and achieved the rank of Eagle Scout at
            age fifteen. I began attending the Swanson School of Engineering at
            the University of Pittsburgh in the fall of 2011.
            </p>

            <p>In college I major in computer engineering and maintain a GPA in
            the top 5% of my department while participating in several
            extracurricular activities. I have served as: Secretary of my
            fraternity (Delta Chi), Freshmen Engineering Peer adviser, Technical
            Director of the Green Hope Orphanage Inc, and president of the Pitt
            chapter of IEEE.
            </p>

            <p>In the summer of 2013 I worked as a software engineer intern for
            <a href="http://kitsolutions.net">KIT Solutions</a> where I developed
            an internal timesheet application. In December of 2013 I achieved
            a long time life goal of mine and was offered a software engienering
            internship at <a href="http://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>. In the
            summer of 2014 I worked on the
            <a href="http://onedrive.com">OneDrive</a> team and I built
            notifications for users of OneDrive who have expiring/expired bonus
            storage. My code is run about 3.5 million times a day and it
            maintains a quality of service of 99.998%. I will be moving back to
            Seattle in September of 2015 where I will return to Microsoft as a
            full-time engineer on the OneDrive team. I'm incredibly excited to
            move to Seattle! It has been a dream of mine to work for
            Microsoft (or another top tech company) for six years. Lots of hard
            work, determination and especially persistence got me to where I am
            today.
