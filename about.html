							<p>My full name is Alexander Manuel Vallejo, and I was born on December 3rd, 1992.
                             I have lived my entire life around the Pittsburgh area, and I am looking forward to moving away
                             when I graduate. I like Pittsburgh, but I would also like a little change of pace.</p>
                            <p>I attended <a href="http://www.olsh.org" >Our Lady of the Sacred Heart</a> High School where I
                            was the director of the school news studio, a member of NHS, and a varsity volleyball player. Also 
                            while in high school I was an active member in <a href="http://www.troop335.net" >Boy Scout Troop 335</a> and achieved the rank of Eagle Scout
                            at age fifteen. My interest in science and technology really took off while I was in high school, and I decided
                            to pursue a career in computer engineering. I began attending the Swanson School of Engineering
                            at the University of Pittsburgh in the fall of 2011.</p>
                            <p>Many long hours of hard work and dedication helped me realize the degree of commitment required to become a professional engineer. My efforts and especially my determination landed my name on the Dean's List! After much consideration, I am dedicated to my future profession. I am looking forward to my future with excitment.  </p>
