            <p>Alex Vallejo is employed by Microsoft as a Software Engineer on the OneDrive team (starting 9/15). He sits on the board for The Green Hope School Inc. as Technology Advisor. A proud 2015 cum laude graduate of the University of Pittsburgh Swanson School of Engineering, Vallejo lives in Pittsburgh awaiting a move to Seattle.</p>

            <p>He spends his time in the API layer of the stack but has experience in all levels. He was an intern at Microsoft on the OneDrive team during summer 2014 where the API code he wrote is run 3.6 million times a day with a quality of service (QoS) of 99.998%. His previous internship was at a company called KIT Solutions where he developed a time sheet application.</p>

            <p>As well as technical skills, Vallejo is talented in leadership. Crediting early experience in leadership development through becoming an Eagle Scout, he is a tactful and respected leader. Additionally achieving Eagle Scout taught him the importance of maintaining a commitment to world and local citizenship through volunteering. Most recently he did a one-month teaching tour in rural Tanzania, Africa for The Green Hope School Inc.</p>

            <p>Vallejo has a Bachelor of Science degree in computer engineering. He was a very active member of the student body serving on the executive boards of six organizations, principally crediting his membership in the Delta Chi Fraternity for assisting him along his successful college career. He attended Our Lady of the Sacred Heart High School in Pittsburgh and still maintains ties there through alumni activities.</p>
