I know when I was trying to decide if corporate housing was the right option for me, pictures of the place I might be living would have been helpful. To this effect, I've provided some. I imagine all corporate housing options are not **identical** but they are probably pretty similar.

This particular configuration is a double in Redmond. It's about 3 miles from Microsoft HQ. Getting to work in heavy traffic takes about 10 minutes and 5 with minimal traffic. Redmond is a great location if you hate long commutes like me!

Not Pictured:
Each room has it's own bathroom with shower/bathtub. There are several large closets: one in each bedroom, two inside the front door, a linen closet, and one outside attached to the porch. The apartment also has it's own dedicated washer and dryer. The porch can also fit two chairs comfortably.
