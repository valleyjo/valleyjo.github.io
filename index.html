<h2>Quick Bio</h2>
<p>I work at Microsoft as a software engineer on the Azure Compute Fabric Controller team. We manage VM allocation and lifecycle. Before that I worked on the OneDrive sync team where I worked on the mac and windows apps. I love the backend development space and find challenges in this space immense and fascinating. I am a detail oriented engineer and I love to go deep on the technology I work with. I am skilled at C# and C++ and have experience with  Objective-C and Java also.</p>
<p>I live in Seattle WA with my beautiful wife Catherine, whom I met in Seattle in 2015. When I'm not exploring the city and doing fun things with Catherine, I'm spending time with friends or in the gym.</p>
<p>I grew up in Pittsburgh, PA where I attended Our Lady of the Scared Heart High School. I am an Eagle Scout. I was a very active member of the student body in college at the University of Pittsburgh where I was a member of the Delta Chi Fraternity. I graduated in 2015 cum laude with a degree in Computer Engineering.</p>
