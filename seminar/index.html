                            <li>When you email professors include the class you're in as well as the time it meets.</li>
                            <li>Make sure you put your name in your email client so people know who is sending them emails! People don't know who amg63@pitt.edu is!</li>
                            <li>GPA counts! Find electives that interest you so they are naturally easier for you.</li>
                            <li>Establish a time management strategy early. Experiment with different techniques and find what works for you.</li>
                            <li>Keep track of your grades and know what classes are "most important" in terms of impact on GPA.</li>
                            <li>Use failure as an oppertunity to improve yourself.</li>
